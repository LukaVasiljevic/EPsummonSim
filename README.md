# Empires & Puzzles Summon Simulator #

***About:***

This fully functional app was build in Android Studio using Java. It simulates the part of the game where user summons new hero/troop. It contains all possible heroes and summons at this moment (*April 2020*).  

Lists of heroes and troops as well as summon probabilites were found on the official Empires & Puzzles forum and they will be updated on quarterly basis or more frequently.

(*this project is done just for practice and it does not have any commercial use to me*)
